# CPSC 6430 - Machine Learning: Implementation and Evaluation
## Course Description: 
This course aims at teaching student how to code machine learning algorithms from basic principles, without machine learning libraries. Topics include supervised learning such as regression and classification; unsupervised learning, such as clustering; and measures of performance such as bias/variance theory, measures, and error metrics. 

## Topics Covered:
